# Bar chart

This could be a webpage that displays the current number of customers in a queue.

It updates every second, and keeps a history of the past 40 values, as an "animated" bar-chart, where the current number of customers is displayed at the very right, and every second the values "scrolls" to the left. The data is just a random number between 0 and 32.

Older values are being greyed out. Small values (0, 1, 2) are colored green and large values (30, 31, 32) red. You can see a number behind each bar when you hover.
